jQuery for reality.

MCP hides the traditional messiness of interacting with real things behind the elegance and
simplicty of a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, allowing you to control your world from the
comfort of a python server. MCP's web-derived tools make it not only possible, but easy to make
the wildest and most ill-advised computer interactions from the late 80's finally come alive in
reality.
