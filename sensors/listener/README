Listen for noise, grok it for commands, then dispatch commands to mcp.

Updating the vocabulary:
1) The list of knownish commands is kept in corpus.txt
2) Add commands and upload to:
   http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html
3) Make a directory called corpus-N, copy the tarball there and unpack it.
4) In main.py, update the prefix with N and add new commands to the commands list.
